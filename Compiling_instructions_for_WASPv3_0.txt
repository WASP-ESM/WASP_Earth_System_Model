//Code compiled on: a Mac Darwin environment (operating system OS X version 10.15.6) using command line compilation on the Terminal; and on a LINUX computing cluster.

//To compile: place the files WAS2_ESM_main.cpp, WASP2_ESM_functions.cpp and WASPv3_ESM_stored_inputs.cpp together in a directory. Add a folder called 'RESULTS' for the results files to be written into.

//Using compiler g++, code can be compiled with command line: g++ -std=c++11 -o filename Main_WASP_ESM.cpp

//This code has *not* been checked across a range of C++ compilers.
//Also, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers may be compiler and platform dependent

//Important code for configuring different experiments:

//Line 79 has the parameter 'Use_stored_params'. If this is set to 0 the model will run Monte Carlo simulations using a random number generator. If this is set to 1 the model uses the stored input parameters within the file WASPv3_ESM_stored_inputs.cpp.

//In the RESULTS folder, the model saves another file called WASPv3_ESM_stored_inputs.cpp, this stores all the model parameter values that pass the observational filter, and can be used for future runs.

//Lines 84 and 85 set the temperature and heat content anomaly datasets used by the observational filter.

//Line 90 sets the number of prior model simulations run when a Monte Carlo method is used.

//Line 82 sets the scenario:

//The manuscript "Goodwin, P. and Cael, B.B. (2020 submitted) Bayesian estimation of Earth?s climate sensitivity and transient climate response from observational warming and heat content datasets" the following future scenarios are used: ssp585 (set Future_scenario = 4); 4xCO2 (set Future_scenario = 18) and 1pctCO2 (set Future_scenario = 15).
