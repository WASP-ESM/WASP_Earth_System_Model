//Code compiled on a Mac Darwin environment, operating system OS X version 10.11.6, using command line compilation on the Terminal.
//To compile: place the files WASP_LGRTC_ESM_main.cpp and WASP_LGRTC_ESM_functions.cpp together in a directory. Add a folder called 'RESULTS' for the results files to be written into.
//Using compiler g++ code can be compiled with command line: g++ -O3 -o WASP_LGRTC_ESM_main.cpp

//This code has *not* been checked across a range of C++ compilers.
//Also, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers may be compiler and platform dependent
